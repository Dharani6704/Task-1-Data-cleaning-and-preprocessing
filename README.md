# Task-1-Data-cleaning-and-preprocessing
# No-show Appointments Data Cleaning

This repository contains a Python script to clean and prepare the `noshowappointments.csv` dataset. The goal of this project is to perform essential data preprocessing steps, making the dataset ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Project Purpose

The primary objective is to take a raw, unstructured dataset and apply a series of cleaning techniques to ensure data quality and consistency. This includes:
- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Standardizing text and date formats.
- Converting data types for numerical analysis.
- Removing invalid data (e.g., negative ages).

## How to Run the Script

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library (`pip install pandas`)
- The `noshowappointments.csv` file must be in the same directory as the script.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `noshowappointments.csv` file in the project folder.
3. Open your terminal and run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python clean_data.py
